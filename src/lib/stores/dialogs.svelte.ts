/**
 * Centralized dialog state management
 *
 * Provides a single source of truth for all dialog/sheet open states.
 * Handlers live in DialogOrchestrator.svelte (dialog/sheet UI) and App.svelte (triggers).
 * The $lib/storage manager also opens the load dialog, and $lib/utils/app-actions
 * opens the cleanupPrompt, export, and share dialogs.
 *
 * Only one dialog can be open at a time (enforced by using single openDialog state).
 * Sheets (mobile bottom sheets) use a separate state since they coexist with dialogs.
